Radiohead - A Moon Shaped Pool [2016]:

01. Burn the Witch (7/10): Fine but unimpressive overall.
02. Daydreaming (7.5/10): Thom's voice isn't working for me here and it is overall a bit predictable, but the production was positively disorienting.
03. Decks Dark (6.5/10): Wholly uneventful.
04. Desert Island Disk (7/10): Decent but underwhelming.
05. Ful Stop (7.5/10): The production worked for me, but again Thom's voice didn't appeal here.
06. Glass Eyes (7.5/10): Nice interlude; good instrumentation.
07. Identikit (7/10): The "And raindrops..." of this album; quite repetitive. The final third (as is the case on much of this album) is redeeming.
08. The Numbers (8/10): Very cinematic portions here; Greenwood shines.
09. Present Tense (8/10): Nice and anxious track. Possibly the best cut of the album.
10. Tinker Tailor... (8/10): Once again, ambiance well-crafted by string arrangements, and coda is great as well.
11. True Love Waits (8/10): A fine ballad. Instrumentation complemented mood particularly well.

Overall: 7.5
