			<td><img src="2.jpg" title="Mac Demarco - This Old Dog (2017). Apart from maybe Moonlight on the River, any of these tracks would be right at home musically on any other Mac Demarco album. That’s not necessarily a bad thing - Mac has definitely found his comfort zone, and he continues to make great music that is warm and soothing without being boring. Additionally, the lyrics here are better than anything Mac has written before, and add to the acoustic, somber vibe of the album. Fans of Mac will definitely enjoy, although some, like me, may be longing for the more energetic songs found on “2” and “Salad Days”. Standout Tracks: Baby You’re Out, Still Beating, On The Level, Moonlight on the River" class="masterTooltip"></td>
			<td><img src="3.jpg" title="Feist - Pleasure (2017). Forget the Feist of iPod commercials past - on her new album, Leslie Feist ditches the indie folk for a new stripped down, almost bluesy, electric sound. Many of the songs here are quite sparse, yet (in most cases) they are able to carry the listener’s interest through their somewhat lengthy run times. I definitely think there are a few tracks that don’t need to be here, but the ones that do will make listening to this album worth your while. Standout Tracks: Pleasure, Any Party, The Wind" class="masterTooltip"></td>

			<td><img src="6.jpg" title="Jay Som - Everybody Works (2017). The official debut album by Jay Som, project of 22 year-old Melina Duterte, this would risk coming across as too derivative, jumping from dream pop to shoegaze and not covering too much new ground, if it weren’t for the intimacy and delicacy of Duterte’s songwriting. Each of the songs on here sounds incredibly “close”, as if they were stories being told by good friends. The end result is an album that is an extremely pleasant listen, and probably one of the best I’ve heard this year. Standout Tracks: The Bus Song, 1 Billion Dogs, Baybee, Everybody Works" class="masterTooltip"></td>
			<td><img src="7.jpg" title="Priests - Nothing Feels Natural (2017). Some pretty engaging, energetic post-punk with a female lead. The best tracks on here are great, but the album seemed to lack any sort of flow or overarching feel, and definitely isn’t something I would use to introduce anyone to this genre. Standout Tracks: Jj, Nothing Feels Natural, Pink White House" class="masterTooltip"></td>

			<td><img src="9.jpg" title="Pond - The Weather (2017). I’ll just come out and say it - this is a much better psychedelic album than Currents. Don’t get me wrong, I love Tame Impala, but Pond (with the help of Kevin Parker in places) really shine on this album, featuring varied instrumentation, excellent production, and a really interesting texture overall. While not necessarily a psych rock record, I would highly recommend this to any fans of the genre, as well as Tame Impala fans a little let down by their recent output.

			<td><img src="15.jpg" title="Mort Garson - Plantasia (1976). Beautiful, captivating early electronic music. I’m not super well versed in the history of electronic, but this sounds like it had to have been pretty ahead of its time. The entire aesthetic and concept of the album is great, albeit a little goofy. Good stuff. Standout Tracks: Plantasia, Concerto for Philodendron and Pothos, Swingin’ Spathiphyllums" class="masterTooltip"></td>
			<td><img src="16.jpg"></td>
			<td><img src="17.jpg" title="Herbie Hancock - Head Hunters (1973). This album deserves this score for “Chameleon” alone, which is 15+ minutes of constantly evolving, energetic jazz-funk the likes of which I’ve personally never hear. Luckily, the rest of the album holds up, with Herbie Hancock providing a stellar atmosphere through four great tracks. Definitely the album for you if you have 41 minutes to kill and are looking for something completely new, but also completely accessible and enjoyable.

			<td><img src="22.jpg" title="Scott Walker - Scott 4 (1969). As far as I’m concerned, this is the pinnacle of baroque pop. Obviously, this album benefits from Scott’s haunting baritone voice, but that should not do anything to discount the wonderful instrumentation, which varies enough from track to track to stay interesting through the album’s entire 32 minute runtime. Some of the songs, such as the much-too-short “On Your Own Again”, almost remind me of a Frank Sinatra song, albeit with a dark, poetic twist. The masterpiece here is definitely “The Seventh Seal”, ambitious in its composition and lyrics, which meld incredibly well to produce an epic, sweeping narrative. While a few lulls in the middle of the album keep me from giving this a perfect score, I would definitely recommend to any music lover, especially those fond of more modern albums of this genre. Standout Tracks: The Seventh Seal, On Your Own Again, The World’s Strongest Man, Rhymes of Goodbye

			<td><img src="24.jpg" title="Exuma - Exuma (1970). Exuma’s self-titled debut album has a stronger sense of place than anything I’ve listened to in a long time. From the opening frog croaks of the first track to the end of the last track, Exuma paints a vivid auditory image of a place completely foreign to modern western culture. As an outside observer looking in, the sounds of this album are absolutely fascinating - the unhinged folk music here is equal parts Bob Dylan and African polyrhythm, and the production and instrumentation provide a uniquely “swampy” feel that contributes to the overall vibe of the music. This is a must-listen for any fan of slightly off-kilter folk, and is sure to become a perennial favorite among many. Standout Tracks: Exuma, the Obeah Man, Dambala, You Don’t Know What’s Going On" class="masterTooltip"></td>
			<td><img src="25.jpg" title="Pixies - Surfer Rosa (1988). While definitely not the most immediately enjoyable “classic” album I’ve listened to recently, that’s kinda the point, isn’t it? This album is full of noisy, abrasive, aggressive tracks, and yet is never so abrasive that it totally pushes the listener away. “Where Is My Mind?” is the obvious highlight here, but some of the other tracks aren’t too far behind, and make for a fresh listening experience even in a world of Pixies clones. Standout Tracks: Bone Machine, River Euphrates, Where Is My Mind?" class="masterTooltip"></td>
			<td><img src="26.jpg" title="David Bowie - Low (1977). If I didn’t know any better, you could play me a song from each side of this album and I would have no idea that they are part of the same work of art. Bowie’s Low starts off with the energetic, electric “Speed Of Life”, and doesn’t slow down through all of Side A. The first 7 tracks on this album (none over 4 minutes long) are fast-paced upbeat songs that recall “Rebel Rebel” more than anything Bowie had previously done, with their prominent electric guitar and smooth rhythms. The last 4 tracks, however, are a complete departure from the rest of the album, and ooze the atmosphere and mystery characteristic of Bowie’s collaborator on this album (and moving forward) Brian Eno. All in all, there’s a reason why this album is heralded as one of Bowie’s best, and it’s a bite-sized bit of music that any fan of Bowie or the genre that he helped popularize will enjoy. Standout Tracks: Speed Of Life, Sound and Vision, Subterraneans" class="masterTooltip"></td>
